# KoomeTrust BMI Calculator

Welcome to the KoomeTrust BMI Calculator! This is a simple tool that allows you to calculate your BMI (Body Mass Index) based on your height and weight.

## Usage

To use the BMI Calculator, simply enter your height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) in the provided input fields. Then click the "Calculate BMI" button to see your results.

The BMI Calculator will display your BMI value and your corresponding health status. If your BMI falls within a healthy range, you will be classified as "healthy". If your BMI is higher than the healthy range, you will be classified as "obese".
